# Raspberry Pi

Let's try to run Docker on a RPi-4b, because we can!

## Installation

I've taken the _convenience_ script from docker and turned it into the steps I believe are performed on a fresh install of Raspbian. This was done not just to simplify the process for future use, but to see the "source" code and ensure I understood what it does - being a PowerShell guy, Bash is sometimes confusing to me and this helped to further my understanding. That said, if statements are proper weird in bash - extra commands suddenly become avaialble!?
